## Overview
This is a rather simple project for people who are learning HTML and CSS. The idea is to build a QR component (image provided) and get it looking as close as possible to the design.

### Steps
1. Initialize the project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share the code with the community if help is needed. 
2. Configure the repository to publish the code to a web address. 
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how to tackle the project. This step is crucial to help think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure the content with HTML. Writing the HTML first can help focus the attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Since it was a small project for beginners, I didn't learn much. I just applied what I have been learning.
I am also really proud of how my container turned out. I centered a div!

```html
<section class = "container">
            
            <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code">

            <p class="improve">
                Improve your front-end skills by building projects
            </p>

            <p class="scan">
                Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level
            </p>

        </section>
```
```css
.container{

    background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 300px;
    border: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    text-align: center;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 5%;
    margin-top: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;

}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning CSS because it is where I have more difficulties. For example, things like margin, padding, and how to center content properly are still a challenge for me.
